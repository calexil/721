# 721 Rules

## 721 Core Rules

### Pre-Game

* The game starts with a 54 card deck shuffled thoroughly and placed face down. To decide who plays first each player cuts to a random card in the deck and the player who reveals the highest card goes first. (The order of card values are as follows, from highest to lowest: Joker, Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10...2, with the suits being counted down ; Spade, Heart, Club, Diamond). In the very unlikely event of a tie(both players cut to a Joker) the cut is repeated until a winner is decided. **This rule is very important, because it pertains to the final scoring as well, ie: if the score is tied at the end of the game the players reveal from their remaining cards(if any) a high card and the aforementioned scoring values are used to determine a winner.**

* After the starting player is decided each player is dealt 7 random cards(which they can look at but should not share with other players) and play begins.

### The Main Game Rules

#### Play

* The starting player begins play by choosing **any** number of cards in their hand that **total 21(Blackjack)** and playing them down in front of them **face up**, a player is allowed to play *as many* 21's(Blackjacks) as they possibly can with the 7 cards in their hand.

* After playing out as many 21's as they can(or at any point in their turn) a player may then discard *up to* 2 cards and then **draw back up to 7 total cards in hand**, this action ends a players turn immediately and play goes to their opponent(s).

* This pattern continues until there are no cards left in the deck to draw, once that occurs the game is over and final scoring begins.

#### Counting to 21(I know it's hard ;_;)

* Cards are counted towards creating 21(Blackjack) based on their standard values in normal Blackjack ie:

Ace = 1/11
Face Cards(King, Queen, Jack) = 10
10 = 10
9 = 9
etc. 
With the exception being the two Jokers, which count as **Wild Aces** but we'll get to that later.

#### Scoring

Scoring is simple, There are two hands that score you points: **Normal** Blackjacks and **Perfect** Blackjacks.

* Every **Normal Blackjack** counts as one(1) point.
* Every **Perfect Blackjack** counts as two(2) points.

##### Perfect Blackjacks

*What the heck is a **Perfect Blackjack**?*

* **Perfect Blackjacks** contain an **Ace** and a card of value **10**(King, Queen, Jack, 10) of the **Same Suit**.

*What the heck is a **Wild Ace**?*

* In 721 the two **Jokers** count as **Wild Aces** (The count as an ace of any suit).

#### Final Scoring

* After there are no more cards left in the deck the players total their scores and the highest score wins. 

* In the event of a tie the players reveal from their remaining cards(if any), a high card with the highest card winning the draw.

### Solitaire

* All of the core rules are followed with the exception being that in solitaire mode the solo player only scores points based on the **remaining unplayed cards against their score**. ie: if a solo player has finished the game with **11 total points** and there are **7 remaining unplayed cards** their **final score** is **4**. The object in solitaire mode is to utilize the entire deck and get a perfect score of **26**, the absolute maximum score achievable with a standard 54 card deck.
