# 721â„¢, A custom card game created by Calexil

## About 721â„¢ the Card Game.

**721â„¢** is a custom card game played with an standard 54 card deck (including the two jokers).

The objective of the game is simple, score the most points before the deck runs out. 

The game can be played in different styles, Solitaire, 1v1, and Free-for-all. 

The rules for each game style differ slightly but the core rules remain the same throughout. 

The Object of the game is to play out as many combinations of cards that total 21(Blackjack) as you possibly can from a hand of 7 cards, which you refill back to seven at the end of each turn. 

Normal blackjacks(combinations of many cards/suits) count as one(1) point, Perfect blackjacks(combinations of an Ace and a card valued '10'[King, Queen, Jack, 10] of the **same suit**) count as two(2) points. 

Play continues until no cards are left in the deck and the player with the highest score wins.
